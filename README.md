## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learn't about JSAPIs which was my very first project for API's.I learnt how to use async functions,catch,await and got to aquire a brief understanding of promises.I also learnt various CSS tricks such as transform(translate) and @keyframes;



### Continued development

I want to focus mainly on understanding how Javascript executes functions as well as the code in general as i seem to have a bit of a problem understanding where exactly to place specific lines of code
